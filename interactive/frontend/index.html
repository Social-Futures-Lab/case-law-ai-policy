            <p>In recent years, there has been a huge rise in popularity of Large Language Model-backed
              conversational AI agents.</p>
            <p>These systems can be really helpful as generalist assistants, supporting people in
              a variety of tasks.</p>
            <p>However, these AI agents have very limited self retrospection and common sense: they may
            eagerly advise on how to conduct morally objectionable actions and might confidently give
            inaccurate advice. Yikes!</p>

                You have been recruited as <strong>a member of the general public</strong> to help
                us teach AI how respond to these challenging situations in a socially acceptable manner!
              </p>
              <p>
                To create this policy guidance, we will place you in a <strong>simulated activity</strong>:
                You will be acting as a <strong>human mentor</strong> who is "shadowing" such an AI assistant
                behind the scenes.
              </p>
              <p>
                In each session, you will see a prompt that involves a <strong>challenging scenario</strong>.
                Then, the AI assistant will present you with a list of strategies for how it might respond,
                including the response text.
                <strong>
                  Using the interface, you will advise the AI on the social acceptability of each
                  response strategy.
