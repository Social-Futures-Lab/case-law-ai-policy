    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Traditionaly, when we talk about "policy" for AI, we often think about broad statements like: "", "", or "".
    However, it can be diffcult to both <em>create</em> and <em>apply</em> these kinds of policies when we encounter the intricacies of how AI interacts with socially-situated everyday settings,

    Thus, we argue that a publicly accepted, actionable, and auditable policy for AI cannot rely on high-level guidelines alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, we draw ideas from the legal framework of "case law" and propose a way to supplement traditional "constitutional" style policies for AI by creating a new "case law" inspired framework.
      We introduce the idea of "case repositories", a collection of high-fidelity scenarios of human/social AI interactions, that can be judged democratically by communities, representative populations, and/or stakeholder groups to become a new form of policy.

    <h3>Our Process</h3>
    <p></p>
    <section>
      <h4>Phase 1: Seeding the Case Repository with Expert Workshops</h4>
      <p>
        We start by compiling a small set of cases based on discourse in online communities (Reddit, Twitter, media outlets, etc.).
        Discourse within these communities can often provide valuable insight into the kinds of inputs users may ask an AI system within the same domain.
        However, for these cases

      <h4>Phase 2: Refine the Case Repository using Public Input</h4>
      <p>
        To grow the existing seed cases into a case repository, we extend seed cases along expert dimensions
        to create new cases that improve clarity and coverage of the case space. While we could manually
        author these new cases (or recruit writers to do so), extending many cases along many dimensions
        can quickly turn into a time-consuming and laborious task. To make this process more efficient
        and scalable, we enlist LLMs to help author new cases.
