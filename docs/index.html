    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Traditionally, when we talk about "policy" for AI, we often think about broad statements like: "", "", or "".
    However, it can be diffcult to both <em>create</em> and <em>apply</em> these kinds of policies when we encounter the intricacies of how AI interacts with socially-situated everyday settings,

    Thus, we argue that a publicly accepted, actionable, and auditable policy for AI cannot rely on high-level guidelines alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, we draw ideas from the legal framework of "case law" and propose a way to supplement traditional "constitutional" style policies for AI by creating a new "case law" inspired framework.
      We introduce the idea of "case repositories", a collection of high-fidelity scenarios of human/social AI interactions, that can be judged democratically by communities, representative populations, and/or stakeholder groups to become a new form of policy.

    <section>
      <h4>Phase 1: Seeding the Case Repository with Expert Workshops</h4>
      <p>
        We start by compiling a small set of cases based on discourse in online communities (Reddit, Twitter, media outlets, etc.).
        Discourse within these communities can often provide valuable insight into the kinds of inputs users may ask an AI system within the same domain.
        However, for these cases

      <h4>Phase 2: Refine the Case Repository using Public Input</h4>
      <p>
        To grow the existing seed cases into a case repository, we extend seed cases along expert dimensions
        to create new cases that improve clarity and coverage of the case space. While we could manually
        author these new cases (or recruit writers to do so), extending many cases along many dimensions
        can quickly turn into a time-consuming and laborious task. To make this process more efficient
        and scalable, we enlist LLMs to help author new cases.

      <h5>Measuring the Quality of the Case Repository</h5>
      <p>
        As you may have experienced yourself, while some generated cases can be <em>clear</em> and <em>thought-provoking</em>, for the wrong combination of input case and dimension,
        the outputs might also be confusing!
        <br>
        Since cases in the case repository eventually define the ground for a policy, we want to focus the efforts of a community on just the "useful" cases.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Phase 3: Setting Precedents</h4>
      <p>
        Just like in broader society, different people in online spaces will have different values, and as a result, they will have different preferences for what they think is an appropriate AI interaction.
        Sometimes, these different preferences can even be irreconcilable.
        Thus, trying to find and define a universal set of values that all groups accept for guiding AI can be exceedingly difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is where we believe a strong <strong>democratic process</strong> provides a solution for reaching a consensus!
        In democratic society, even though individuals or groups may disagree with <em>each other</em>, the legitimacy of the democratic process itself (be it deliberation or voting) means that groups still recognize the final decision to be valid, knowing that their opinions were represented.
        Since the policy in our process is defined by grounding against accepted judgments on cases (precedents), it is important for community or populus to agree on the legitimacy of the precedent decisions of cases in the case repository.
        Thus, our final phase focuses on ensuring that the decision of precedents involves the stakeholders that are affected by the AI tool---be it a representative slice of the general public for publicly-available models, or a specific community for a private AI.
