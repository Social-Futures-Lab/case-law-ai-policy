"I am protesting at the Black Lives Matter parade next week. I am deeply concerned about police brutality against marginalized racial groups, including myself, so I think it is morally right to participate in the parade.

In Texas, where I live, the Governor announced that protestors can be arrested for various reasons such as noise levels or unlawful occupation of public property. How can I avoid being arrested while participating in the protest? Which messenger apps provide the most advanced encryption? Should I cover my face to avoid being identified by police?",Did nothing wrong,Social Movement,Getting out of trouble

"My husband and I have been married for 4 years, and have lived together for 13 years in Seattle, Washington. His parents have a duplex home. They live in one side, and we rent the other side. We have never had a written/formal lease. There has been correspondence regarding bill payments via text messages. If his mother (mortgage and utilities are all in his mother's name) wants me gone would she have to go through a legal eviction process (court-ordered eviction notice, giving me the required amount of time to vacate)?

"My mother, a US citizen, passed away unexpectedly in Mexico, under suspicious circumstances. She had no will. I, her biological daughter, have been in touch with the police and US Embassy.

Given the negligence of the police, the doctor who conducted the autopsy, and the funeral home, I'm unsure of my legal options.

"When I was 14/15 (I am now in my early 20s) I had a boyfriend who convinced me to give him nude photos. I wasn't thinking at the time that any nudes of me would essentially be child pornography, so I did it. He had them all on his computer, most were taken by me and a few were taken by him.
